# 421-Lab-Notes

Here is where you can see the lab notes for Luciana Etcheverry's Econometrics (EC421) for Fall 2019. I'll periodically update these after class on Tuesdays, and I will generally try to make these serve as a complement rather than a substitute for lab.

Some Useful Resources:

[Getting Started With R](https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/201141096-Getting-Started-with-R) 
- A nice collection of resources for those starting out in R.

[Tidyr cheatsheet](https://github.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/blob/master/data-import.pdf) 
- A few of the most useful pages you can find.

[ggplot2 cheatsheet](https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/ggplot2-cheatsheet.pdf)
- Another few of the most useful pages you can find, ggplot this time

- Review of regression objects, performing GQ, BP and white tests, and heteroskedasticity standard errors.
An aside:

If you're adventurous, Grant McDermott's data science for economists is an amazing resource. It's designed for PhD students, but not those with any experience with computers. If metrics is your calling, you might enjoy looking at these.
